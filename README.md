# Identifying Entities in Healthcare Data
A health tech company called BeHealthy has a web platform that allows doctors to list their services and manage patient interactions and provides services for patients such as booking interactions with doctors and ordering medicines online. Here, doctors can easily organise appointments, track past medical records and provide e-prescriptions, thus generating huge amount of data day by day and through which we can take proper decisions using machine learning.
